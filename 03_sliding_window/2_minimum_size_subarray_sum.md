## Minimum Size Subarray Sum

### Problem Description
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

### Example
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```
```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window (two-pointer) technique. The idea is to maintain a window that expands and contracts to find the minimum length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to `0`.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of the current window.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to store the minimal length of the subarray. Set it to a large value initially.

2. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right and adding `nums[right]` to `current_sum`.
   - While `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, update `min_length` to the smaller value between `min_length` and the current window length (`right - left + 1`), then contract the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right and subtracting `nums[left]` from `current_sum`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If `min_length` was updated, return it. Otherwise, return `0` indicating no valid subarray was found.

### Python Code
```python
def min_subarray_len(target, nums):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
    
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

### Java Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];
            
            while (currentSum >= target) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                currentSum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return minLength != Integer.MAX_VALUE ? minLength : 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:
   - In both Python and Java, we initialize `left` and `right` to `0`, `current_sum` to `0`, and `min_length` to a large value (`float('inf')` in Python and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in Java).

2. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - We iterate through the array with the `right` pointer.
   - For each element, we add it to `current_sum`.
   - While `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, we update `min_length` to the smaller value between `min_length` and the current window length (`right - left + 1`), then contract the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right and subtracting `nums[left]` from `current_sum`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After the loop, if `min_length` was updated, we return it. Otherwise, we return `0` indicating no valid subarray was found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal length subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target using the sliding window technique, making it an O(n) solution where n is the length of the array. This guarantees an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.
