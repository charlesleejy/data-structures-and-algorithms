## Valid Anagram

### Problem Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Solution Approach
To determine if one string is an anagram of another, we need to ensure that both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies. We can achieve this by counting the frequency of each character in both strings and comparing the counts.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Check Lengths**:
   - If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal, they cannot be anagrams, so return `false`.

2. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Use a hashmap (or dictionary) to count the frequency of each character in both strings.

3. **Compare Frequency Counts**:
   - Compare the frequency counts of characters in both hashmaps. If they are the same, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Python Code
```python
def is_anagram(s, t):
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    
    count_s = {}
    count_t = {}
    
    for char in s:
        count_s[char] = count_s.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in t:
        count_t[char] = count_t.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    return count_s == count_t
```

### Java Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Map<Character, Integer> countS = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> countT = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            countS.put(c, countS.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            countT.put(c, countT.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return countS.equals(countT);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Check Lengths**:
   - In both Python and Java, we check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, we return `false` because the strings cannot be anagrams if they have different lengths.

2. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - In Python, we use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`. We iterate through each character in `s` and `t`, incrementing the count for each character in their respective dictionaries.
   - In Java, we use a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`. We iterate through each character in `s` and `t`, updating the count for each character in their respective hashmaps.

3. **Compare Frequency Counts**:
   - In both Python and Java, we compare the frequency counts of characters in `count_s` and `count_t`. If they are equal, we return `true`, indicating that `t` is an anagram of `s`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check if `t` is an anagram of `s` by comparing character frequency counts using hashmaps, making it an O(n) solution where n is the length of the strings. This guarantees an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.
