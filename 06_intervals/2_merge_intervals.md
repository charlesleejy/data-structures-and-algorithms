## Merge Intervals

### Problem Description
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Example
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - Sort the intervals based on their start times.

2. **Merge the Intervals**:
   - Initialize a list to store the merged intervals.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals and compare each interval with the last merged interval.
   - If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval, merge them by updating the end time of the last merged interval.
   - If the current interval does not overlap, add it to the list of merged intervals.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - Sort the intervals based on the start time of each interval. This ensures that intervals that can potentially overlap are adjacent in the list.

2. **Initialize Merged List**:
   - Create an empty list to store the merged intervals.

3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**:
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.
   - For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last interval in the merged list.
   - If it overlaps, update the end time of the last merged interval to the maximum end time of the two overlapping intervals.
   - If it does not overlap, add the current interval to the merged list.

### Python Code
```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        if current[0] <= last[1]:
            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])
        else:
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged
```

### Java Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) {
            return new int[0][];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int[] last = intervals[0];
        merged.add(last);
        
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            if (interval[0] <= last[1]) {
                last[1] = Math.max(last[1], interval[1]);
            } else {
                last = interval;
                merged.add(last);
            }
        }
        
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - In both Python and Java, we sort the intervals based on the start time.
   - In Python, we use `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`.
   - In Java, we use `Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));`.

2. **Initialize Merged List**:
   - We initialize an empty list to store the merged intervals.
   - In Python, we initialize it with the first interval: `merged = [intervals[0]]`.
   - In Java, we use an `ArrayList` and add the first interval: `List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>(); merged.add(intervals[0]);`.

3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**:
   - We iterate through the sorted intervals starting from the second interval.
   - For each interval, we compare it with the last merged interval.
   - If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval (`if current[0] <= last[1]:` in Python and `if (interval[0] <= last[1]) {` in Java), we update the end time of the last merged interval.
   - If the current interval does not overlap, we add it to the list of merged intervals.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - In Python, we return the `merged` list directly.
   - In Java, we convert the `ArrayList` to an array and return it using `merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently merge overlapping intervals by first sorting them and then iterating through them to combine overlapping intervals, making it an O(n log n) solution due to the sorting step. This guarantees an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.
