## Simplify Path

### Problem Description
Given a string `path`, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
- The path starts with a single slash '/'.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
- The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')

Return the simplified canonical path.

### Example
```
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
```
```
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```
```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
```
```
Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

### Solution Approach
To simplify the given path, we can use a stack to process the components of the path. By iterating through each component, we can decide whether to push it onto the stack, pop the stack, or ignore it based on the rules of Unix-style file systems.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Split the Path**:
   - Split the path by the slash '/' to get the individual components.

2. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of the valid components of the simplified path.

3. **Process Each Component**:
   - Iterate through each component:
     - If the component is empty or a single period '.', ignore it.
     - If the component is a double period '..', pop the stack if it's not empty (to go up one directory level).
     - Otherwise, push the component onto the stack (it's a valid directory name).

4. **Build the Simplified Path**:
   - Join the components in the stack with a single slash '/' to form the simplified path.

5. **Return the Simplified Path**:
   - Ensure the path starts with a slash '/'.

### Python Code
```python
def simplify_path(path):
    components = path.split('/')
    stack = []
    
    for component in components:
        if component == '' or component == '.':
            continue
        if component == '..':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(component)
    
    return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

### Java Code
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        String[] components = path.split("/");
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (String component : components) {
            if (component.equals("") || component.equals(".")) {
                continue;
            }
            if (component.equals("..")) {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push(component);
            }
        }
        
        return "/" + String.join("/", stack);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Split the Path**:
   - In both Python and Java, we split the path by '/' to get the individual components.
   - In Python, we use `components = path.split('/')`.
   - In Java, we use `String[] components = path.split("/");`.

2. **Initialize a Stack**:
   - We use a stack to keep track of the valid components of the simplified path.
   - In Python, we use a list as a stack: `stack = []`.
   - In Java, we use a `Stack` object: `Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();`.

3. **Process Each Component**:
   - We iterate through each component:
     - If the component is empty or a single period '.', we ignore it.
     - If the component is a double period '..', we pop the stack if it's not empty.
     - Otherwise, we push the component onto the stack as it's a valid directory name.
   - In Python, we use:
     ```python
     for component in components:
         if component == '' or component == '.':
             continue
         if component == '..':
             if stack:
                 stack.pop()
         else:
             stack.append(component)
     ```
   - In Java, we use:
     ```java
     for (String component : components) {
         if (component.equals("") || component.equals(".")) {
             continue;
         }
         if (component.equals("..")) {
             if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                 stack.pop();
             }
         } else {
             stack.push(component);
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Build the Simplified Path**:
   - We join the components in the stack with a single slash '/' to form the simplified path.
   - In Python, we use `return '/' + '/'.join(stack)`.
   - In Java, we use `return "/" + String.join("/", stack);`.

5. **Return the Simplified Path**:
   - We ensure the path starts with a slash '/'.

This approach ensures that we efficiently simplify the given Unix-style path using a stack to manage the directory components, making it an O(n) solution where n is the length of the path. This guarantees an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.
